- flow should be controlled with a structural editor (node and/or block based)G
- rpg style inventory management
- message pre/postprocessing
- optional append-only log mode
- support for message trees out of the box
  - this means messages need parent ids! figure out how to add support for that to the `ai` package.
    maybe in metadata?
- modular/extensible
- optional comments for all the things! esp. lorebook entries (which technically already have a comment field, but sillytavern uses it wrongly), chat messages, cards themselves, lorebooks, and group chats.
- ids (for overwriting) and (optionally) version history for cards
- derived tags (anypov -> fempov + malepov + enbypov + futapov. rawtag:fempov to hide derived tags, switch -> dominant + submissive)
  - this needs to be defined somewhere (ideally fully user configurable)
    - but it should come with one or more sets of these. e.g. rp tagsets will be different than ones for other purposes
    - aliases that work in search
  - the ability to group tags for each character in a scenario. e.g. female+red hair, and the ability to use that fact in search
  - the ability to save searches
- catch and display errors on nodes
- macros for pronouns! {{user_she}} {{user_her}} {{user_hers}} {{user_he}} {{user_him}} {{user_his}}. consider whether this will be possible to use for second/first person too
- inventory (and stats)! useful for regular bots too so they can track clothing (+ closet), weather, days, dates, pregnancy etc. make sure the user can edit it arbitrarily! ideally with good ux
- if/else node or switch case node??
- a way to merge and split conversations between multiple characters
- node to get the n-th element of a list (needs to be implemented per list type), or a key of a stringdict, and the n-th last element of a list (defaults to 0)
